# Vanilla Javascript Snake App

My rendition of the simple game snake, where you try to eat the apple without also eating your tail or going out of bounds.

### Summary
This app taught me a lot about Javascript fundamentals.  I had little experience with things like anonymous functions, IEFEs and arrow functions going into the project.  By the end of it, I had gotten a good grasp on these concepts and learned much more.
