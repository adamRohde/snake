# Vanilla Javascript Snake App

Simple snake game where you try to eat the "apple" without hitting your tail or going out of bounds.

## Summary
This app taught me a lot about Javascript fundamentals.  I had little experience with things like anonymous functions, IEFEs and arrow functions going into this project.  By the end of it, I had gotten a good grasp on these concepts and learned much more.  I hope you enjoy!
